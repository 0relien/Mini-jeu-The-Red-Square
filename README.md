# Mini-jeu-The-Red-Square
A short project I learnt more about JavaScript with.

It's a game which in you can move a small red square in an area. That's all.
I made this project to challenge myself during my learning of JavaScript.


I made the code as much organized as I could.

To move the square, you can use your arrows keys, ZQSD or WASD. It's simple.
